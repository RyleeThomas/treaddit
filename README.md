# Treaddit

## Description:
  
   This is an awesome app that helps connect people to hiking trails that are right for them. By collaborating with other users, our treadditors can post, review, and comment on trails, painting a picture of the kinds of trails that could be perfect for their expiditions. This app includes important information about the trails, such as if the trail is dog or bike friendly, as well as how long they are
